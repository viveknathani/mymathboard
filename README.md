# mymathboard

mymathboard is a GUI application that allows you make graphs, run calculations, or just write random text. Think of it like a whiteboard that can optionally tap into the powerful compute capabilities of your computer when desired.

These are very early days for mymathboard and I hope I can make some cool progress with it in the coming weeks and months.
